#Ising Model 

#Introduction
This code is designed to run simple Monte Carlo simulations for Scalar Field Theory simulations.
It calculates observables of the Ising Model using a Metropolis Guided random walk and averaging over the
observables for a series of lattice configurations.  It currently outputs the Magnetization, Free Energy, and 
Susceptibility for each configuration and records them in a text file.

#Purpose
This code was written as an introductory research project and as a means to study methods of symmetry breaking in
the Ising Model.  It is an offshoot from my other repository, and is part of an Assignment for Computational Physics 3.  

#Acknowledgements
This code uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator.  More information can be found in the mt64 source file.
